## Project 2: Memory Allocator

This project implements a memory allocator (liballocator) which supports Buddy Allocation and Slab Allocation schemes. The memory allocator supports my_malloc() and my_free(), which is analogous to the C library's malloc() and free(). The memory allocator also mimics how a typical operating systems manages heap memory for user program.
